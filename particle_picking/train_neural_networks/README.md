This directory contains the scripts necessary to train the denoising autoencoder (CDAE.py) and subsequently, the fully-convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation (train_FCN_for_semseg.py along with helper script, instance_segmentation_helper_methods.py).

Training the neural networks requires synthetic data training sets.
