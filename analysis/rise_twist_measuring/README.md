The scripts in this directory were used to measure the rise and twist of deformed actin models. To minimize edge effects of the spline interpolations used to determine the curved filament axes, models were extended using the auto_stitching_3stich.py script through Chimera. 

The frealix_like_parameterization_extended_multiChains.py script was used to determine the curved central axis and to measure the rise and twist. Lastly, the plot_helicalParams_includeCurvature_forGraphpad.py script was used to format the data to generate the rise/twist plots used in the paper.
